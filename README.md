# accelerated-computing-CUDA-Python
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from the course "Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA Python" by NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute with exercises and assesments.

The course itself consists of 3 different modules (see Jupyter notebooks):

* Introduction to CUDA Python with Numba

* Custom Kernels and Memory Management for CUDA Python with Numba

* Multidimensional Grids and Shared Memory for CUDA Python with Numba

(Currently I am working on the "Custom Kernels and Memory Management for CUDA Python with Numba" section)
